# Web Mini

Welcome to **Web Mini**! This project dynamically fetches and displays the directories (projects) from the `vivalchemy/web-mini` GitHub repository. The project showcases these directories in a visually appealing grid format, using GitHub's official colors for a sleek, dark-themed user interface.

## Features

- Displays the project names in a responsive grid layout.
- Each project card is clickable, leading directly to the corresponding GitHub directory.
- Dark theme with GitHub's official color scheme for an aesthetically pleasing look.

## How It Works

This project uses the GitHub API to retrieve the contents of the `vivalchemy/web-mini` repository. It dynamically generates a grid of clickable cards based on the directories found in the repository.

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Custom styles using GitHub-inspired colors and CSS variables for easy theming.
- **JavaScript**: Fetches the data from the GitHub API and dynamically renders the project cards.
